**Examensarbete Webbutveckling â€“ 2024**

An AI-driven tool for intelligent and consistent code review. The system learns from user feedback and improves suggestions over time.

## Project Structure

This project uses a modern monorepo structure:

```
/apps
  /web       # Frontend (React + Vite)
/api         # Backend (Node.js + Express)
/packages
  /shared    # Shared libraries, types, and utilities
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```

### Building

Build all packages:

```bash
npm run build
```
